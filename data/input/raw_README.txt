The zip file in the same folder is the BCTS source dataset in it's entirety.  The CLASS field is sadly not domain controlled and has (S6), S6, S6-A etc for values.  I will let you do the string massage magic to better consolidate the stream classes!"

Subject: BC Fish Passage dataset

Hi Hailey, 

I heard that you'd moved on - congrats on the new gig, condolences on being back to working with fish passage data :)

As Craig probably mentioned, for the last year or so all focus has been publication of the salmon/steelhead models - there is no current Provincial model for 'all fish'.

The older 'all fish' model can be download here:

Notes:
- this data predates all work/changes/fixes done in collaboration with CWF and I do not have a comprehensive list of what is missing/changed
- do not use the modelled crossings layer, the current version is in the latest distribution at https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/freshwater-fish-habitat-accessibility-model-pacific-salmon-and-steelhead
- the files do not contain modelled channel width but you can grab it here: https://www.hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/public/fwapg/fwa_stream_networks_channel_width.csv.gz

Note the channel width model is not valid in areas with contributing areas outside of BC (and these streams are not noted in the data!).  Adding contributing areas outside of BC is still on my todo list but only PSF has been asking for this.

I'm not sure if the 'all fish' dataset contains gradient - if not I'll have to leave that one up to you. As you'll know, it is just a derived column that you can add like this: 
https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg/blob/main/db/tables.sql#L396C3-L397C70

If you can wait until I'm under contract with Craig again (or if MoF would like to support our work directly), it would be very straightforward to create and dump a current 'all fish' model with all the data you're looking for. 

hope this helps!

Simon
