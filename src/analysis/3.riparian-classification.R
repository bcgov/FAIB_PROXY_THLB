In order to identify those stream reaches, bring in the manually created dataset of stream id's where contributing area is outside BC. This table was initialized by using Simon Norris's [fwapg](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) package and then iterating over every blue_line_key in the province using this [function](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg/blob/main/db/functions/FWA_UpstreamBorderCrossings.sql). See helper script here: `src/analysis/2.riparian-fwapg-pre-processing.R`. The results stream reaches were manually reviewed and removed if ~ 80-90% of the contributing area was within BC. Stream reaches identified as having contributing area's outside BC were compared with Foundry Spatial's BC Water Tools watershed reporting tool (where watersheds extend outside the province in the following NRO regions: Skeena, Peace, Omineca, Kootenay).

## For stream classification, the FWA rivers polygonal dataset is usually used in Timber Supply Analyses. It is important to include it to ensure the river area's are included in the riparian zones. In order to determine the stream classification per FWA River Poly, the most common (I.e. mode) classification was used.
