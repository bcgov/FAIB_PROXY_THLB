## Identify streams that have upstream catchments extending beyond the borders of 
## British Columbia (BC). The reason for this is that channel width is determined 
## by the size of the upstream watershed. Since the upstream watershed area is
## calculated based on the BC border, any stream with a catchment area outside 
## BC will yield inaccurate measurements.
